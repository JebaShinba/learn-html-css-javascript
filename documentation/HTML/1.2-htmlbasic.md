## HTML Headings

* The HTML heading tags are used to create headings for the content of a webpage. These tags are typically placed inside the body tag. HTML offers six heading tags, from **h1** to **h6** , each displaying the heading in a different font size.
  
  ```HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">    
      <title>
        HTML heading tag
        </title>
    </head>

    <body>
      <h1>Heading 1 (h1)</h1>
      <h2>Heading 2 (h2)</h2>
      <h3>Heading 3 (h3)</h3>
      <h4>Heading 4 (h4)</h4>
      <h5>Heading 5 (h5)</h5>
      <h6>Heading 6 (h6)</h6>
    </body>

    </html>
  ```

## HTML Paragraph and Break Elements
* HTML ```<p>``` tags are used to write paragraph statements on a webpage. * They start with the ```<p>``` tag and end with ```</p>```. 
* The HTML ```<br>``` tag is used to insert a single line break and does not require a closing tag. In HTML, the break tag is written as ```<br>```.
  
  ```HTML
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en">

    <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" 
          content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  ## HTML Horizontal Line
* The HTML ```<hr>``` tag is used to divide a page into sections by creating a horizontal line that spans from the left to the right side of the page. This is an empty tag and does not require a closing tag or any additional attributes.
